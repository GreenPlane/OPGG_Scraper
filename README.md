### Current functionality ###
Automate update & show-more functionality on op.gg.  Only scrapes play time. 
### How to use ###
Use latest release. Download and unzip folder to desktop. Launch OPGG_Scraper.bat.
### Why this needs a fake browser ###
OP.GG only displays 20 games at a time.  To see more match history, you need to click show more.  The show more button is not stored as easily accessible JSON data, so pressing the button needs to be emulated.
### Latest changes ###
- Reduced memory usage
- Eliminated unnecessary imports
